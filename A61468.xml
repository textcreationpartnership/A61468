            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 If God be holy, then whatſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Him, is holy. Holineſſe in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men is imperfect (as was ſaid before) and the moſt holy of them working according to the reliques of corruption bring forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is evil. In which regard both al men ought to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> and every one ought to take heed that he doe not follow others further then they are followers of Chriſt. Yea even <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocence, though he had no corruption, yet was mutably holy, and ſo by the abuſe of his free will might commit evill, which alſo he did. But God being perfectly and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, all his works are neceſſarily holy. And ſo all His lawes or commandements, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. Therefore we muſt not murmur againſt God when He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts us or our friends, or ſuffers us to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64461:8"/>afflicted by men; or when He ſpares or does good to our enemies. Neither muſt we doubt or delay to obey any of His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; ſeeing, if it appeare to be a command proceeding from God, there is no queſtion to be made but it is moſt holy, and juſt, and good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If God be holy, then alſo He loves holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in men, and hates iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. &amp; 11.7. <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.13.

                     <p n="4">4. Hereby we ſee how neceſſary Chriſt is for them that would come unto God. For as we are altogether polluted and unclean, till we be ſprinkled and waſhed with the blood of Chriſt; ſo the beſt works that can proceed from us in our beſt eſtate in this life, would ſtink in the noſtrils of the moſt holy God, if they were not accepted in and for Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64461:8"/>that make ſo holy a God the author of ſin. It is true indeed there is ſcarce any to be found that dares averre this in direct terms. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees themſelves would rather feigne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle, an evil god, then make the good and holy God the authour of ſinne. But neither can they be excuſed from this blaſphemy, who embrace and ſtifly maintain ſuch opinions, from whence this followes by neceſſary conſequence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All that live impurely; whether they do it openly, as profane perſons; or cloſely, as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Theſe ſurely are either atheiſts denying God, or His omniſcience or His hatred of ſin; or elſe they are notoriouſly hardened, that they dare commit ſuch things before His moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eyes, which they would be aſhamed to commit before any ordinary honeſt man. Let ſuch men know, that the Holy one of Iſrael hates iniquity, and will without reſpect of perſons render to wicked men the wages of their ſinne, that is, eternall death.

                  </list>
                  <p>The externall cauſe was the devil (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of ſin, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.8.) whoſe hatred and envy againſt God and all mankind is ſuch, that he leaves no man at all untempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But eſpecially and above others he would labour to draw ſuch a man as David into ſinne, in a double reſpect, viz. of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64461:20"/>
                     <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>authority.</hi> For the former, the devil knew full well, that the ſins of David, who had made ſo great a progreſſe in the profeſſion and practiſe of religion, would give great occaſion both of ſcandall to the weak, and of blaſphemy to the wicked and profane, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. For the latter, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſerpent knew that moſt men would frame themſelves after the kings example; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſuch who had before kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at leaſt within the bounds of outward civility for feare of diſpleaſing the king, when they ſhould know how greatly he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, would break out into all impiety. He might hope alſo that by that means the kings mind might be alienated from good men, as whom he might ſuppoſe to be offended at his ſins; whereupon haply he might raiſe perſecution againſt them (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10.) and thereby ſuch as had not already entred into a godly courſe of life, might be kept back, and ſuch as had, might apoſtatiſe or fall back from it. Or, ſuppoſe Davids ſinnes could have been concealed from the vulgars notice, yet it would have been very probable, that a king conſcious to himſelf of ſuch ſinnes would not have been very ſevere in puniſhing others; whereby ſin upon hope of impunity would have ſpread far and wide,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64461:20"/>and have overflowed the whole land.</p>
                  <p>The internall cauſes are different according to the diverſity of ſinnes. But the principall and direct cauſe, <hi>perſe &amp; conſilio,</hi> was the will determining the power or faculty to an undue object, or an undue manner. The previous or antecedent cauſes, which made way for that determination, were negligence in uſing the means to avoid ſin (viz. watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, prayer, attention to Gods word &amp;c.) and the entertaining and harbouring wicked thoughts ſo long, till they had driven away the Spirit of grace, captivated right reaſon, and obtained the conſent of the will.</p>

But againſt this opinion (ſo abſurd, that it is a wonder the devil himſelf is not aſhamed to perſwade any man to it) there needs no more to be ſaid for the preſent, but that David (another manner of man for holineſſe and perfection then the beſt of them) had his iniquities, and ſo called and accounted of them.</p>

Is ſin grown leſſe dangerous, or men more skilfull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it now then heretofore? Sin was wont to be very watchfull and crafty to catch men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. 2 It was wont to be ſo ſtrong that none but Chriſt, Who hath power to ſubdue all things unto Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was able to deliver any that once came within the reach of it. 3 It was wont to be ſo cruell, that look who were not pluck'd out of its jawes by Chriſt, it would uſe them moſt unmercifully. All the miſeries of this life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſin, and yet all doe not ſatisfy the cruelty of it, but at laſt it brings to death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. Nor is it yet ſatisfied: for it drawes the ſoul alſo to the place of torment, and at laſt the body alſo united to it, and ſo drowns the whole man in wofull perdition. Nor is it yet fully ſatisfied: for being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt an infinite juſtice, it requires that the ſinner ſhould likewiſe undergoe an infinite puniſhment. But becauſe the creature being finite can not undergoe a puniſhment infinite in meaſure, therefore it reſts (though hardly) content with a puniſhment infinite in duration. Such was ſin wont to be. And is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64461:22"/>it now grown to ſome better terms of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? No ſurely, it is as ready to intrap men now as ever; which appears by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ounding of it every where, and daily enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch as would think much not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted very wiſe men. And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> it holds thoſe it once ſeiſes upon, as faſt now as ever: for ſtill that ſtands good, that <hi>there is no Name under heaven whereby men can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but onely the Name of Jeſus; it is onely He that can ſave His people from their ſinnes.</hi> Laſtly, the rigor in binding over to puniſhment is nothing abated; the ſame law being broken, and the ſame infinite juſtice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Well then, ſin being the ſame it was wont to be, why are not we ſo watchfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as the ſervants of God have been in former times? who were ſo wary that in ſome things they would not doe all they might, but uſed to make railes on either ſide their way to heaven, leſt unawares they ſhould fall into ſinne; as never thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves far enough out of the reach of it, till they ſhould get to heaven. But oh the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing wit, the undaunted courage, the firm faith of our age! All foregoing generations were but babes to us the world had never any men to ſhew till we came in play. We know ſo exactly how far we may goe in every thing,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64461:22"/>and can ſo accurately (to the very cleaving of a haire) diſtinguiſh between the uſe and abuſe of things, that we ſcorn to loſe any jote of our privileges. Yea many times we make a ſport of it, to ſhew how nigh the pits brink we can goe, and yet not fall in. Nay we mock, and ſometimes deadly hate ſuch as dare not goe ſo far as we think they might. Thoſe proverbs of <hi>not touching pitch,</hi> or <hi>not putting coals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſome,</hi> &amp;c. befitted thoſe ſimple ſouls in time of yore, but are now out of date. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Job! why wouldſt thou ſo reſtrain thy ſelf as to <hi>make a covenant with thine eyes not to look upon a maid?</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 31.1.) we have ſuch as can dally with them, and dance with them, and court them whole nights together, &amp; yet look to the main chance well enough: who much delight in laſcivious ſongs, wanton plaies, and ſuch like frothy execrable filth, &amp; yet never any infection once comes neare them; nay they can pick as good leſſons out of theſe as others doe out of ſermons. David, what a ſilly weakling waſt thou, to think thou couldſt not keep Gods commandements, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou didſt firſt proclaim, <hi>Away from me ye wicked?</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115.) And Solomon, thou the wiſeſt of men, &amp; hadſt no more wit, but to forbid ill company, and that ſix times together with a breath? (<hi>Prov</hi> 4.14 15.) He
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64461:23"/>is no body now adaies that is not for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. We have them, that care not if the devil himſelfe came into their company, if he would not hurt their bodies; and would not fear a ſtraw what he could doe to their ſouls. No, their knowledge is ſo ſound, their faith ſo ſtrong, and their hearts ſo good to God, that they ſcorn any company ſhould doe hurt on them. And Paul, why wouldſt thou be ſo ſtrict as to <hi>keep under thy body,</hi> &amp;c. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.) as though a man may not pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelf with all variety of delicates, and yet be far enough from reprobation? Not to bring any more inſtances, we have ſome taſt of the marvellous wit of our happy age. But if it be well compared with the wiſdome of thoſe forenamed Saints of God, we ſhall find, that they out of a deep deſire of Gods glory and their own ſalvation, and a ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feare of the ſtrength of ſin and their own weakneſſe, bent their whole endeavour to keep as far from ſin as poſſibly they could; and our men out of a love of their luſts, and a tickling deſire to give them ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, labour to come as near to ſin as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they can without falling into it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we may well imagine it is not for nothing that the onely wiſe God hath forbidden the occaſions ſo expreſſely in Scripture. See for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64461:23"/>the occaſions of drunkenneſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20, 31. Of whoredome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.25, &amp;c. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.6, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide here is comfort for an humble broken hearted Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> who is ſo poſſeſſed with the horrour of his ſinnes, that he makes queſtion whether they can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or no. Conſider well of this Doctrine, <hi>David haed his iniquities:</hi> And were not they as ill as thine? But ſay that for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or outward act, and number, thine be worſe then his; yet weigh the circumſtances. He was more bound to God by outward bleſſings then thou art: and I ſuppoſe, thou that thinkeſt ſo meanly of thy ſelf, wilt not ſay but he had more ſtrength of grace to have reſiſted his ſins, then ever thou hadſt. But yet ſuppoſe that both for ſubſtance and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, thy ſins be every way worſe then his; yet doſt thou think that he taſted the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry utmoſt of Gods mercy? Is there no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of it, then was ſhewed on him? Yes ſurely, Gods mercy reacheth unto the clouds, yea is infinite as Himſelf. But it muſt be remembred all this while to whom I ſpeak, to the humble, broken-hearted ſinner: for him alone is this comfort provided. If any of you had a diſh of dainty meat provided for ſome ſpeciall friend ill at eaſe, or weary
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64461:24"/>with travell &amp;c. and a licorous boy ſhould begin to finger it before it came at the table, I ſuppoſe you would rap him over the knuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and tell him, Hands off, it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him. Even ſo muſt I deale with any wicked profane man, that ſhall offer to catch at Davids example. Thou muſt know that this ſerves to refreſh ſuch as are weary and heavy laden with their ſins, and not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thine unruly luſts. Oh, but thou wilt ſay, I do not meane to loſe my hold ſo: this is the beſt refuge that I have againſt cenſorious preciſe fellowes. When they check me for my faults, I can tell them, I am not the firſt, nor ſhall be the laſt: I have my faults, as who hath not? I hope David himſelf was not without. And thus I can beare out the matter in ſome good faſhion. But take this plea from me, and then all is gone. Well then, if thou wilt needs ſtick ſo cloſe to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids example, let us make ſome brief compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between him and thee, and ſee how far ye run parallel. David had his faults, ſo haſt thou: he repented of them, ſo doſt not thou: he upon his repentance obtained pardon and ſalvation, ſo ſhalt not thou in thine impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And what good now will Davids ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doe thee? But for ſuch an one as I ſpake of before, let not the horrour of thy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64461:24"/>ſins drive thee to deſpaire, but ſtir thee up to godly ſorrow, working repentance unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not to be repented of.</p>

                        </label> I anſwer, ſeeing remiſſion of ſinnes is the act of God alone according to His good pleaſure; therefore we muſt not judge of it according to our own imaginations (which may eaſily deceive us, either on the one ſide through preſumption, or on the other through ſcrupulouſneſſe) but according to Gods word, wherein He hath revealed his will ſo farre as it concerns us to know. Now from the word of God we may gather two Notes of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. One, and that a moſt evident one, is taken <hi>à priore,</hi> from that which goes before forgiveneſſe, thus: It is moſt certaine that God will doe whatſoever he hath promiſed, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64461:28"/>For as being moſt faithfull and ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable He neither will nor can change His mind; ſo being omniſcient He knowes, and being omnipotent He is able abundantly to performe His word. If therefore we would know whether our ſinnes be forgiven; we muſt ſee whether our ſpirit can witneſſe, that we by the grace of God are of the number of them, to whom God hath in Scripture teſtified the promiſe of forgiveneſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.43.</p>
                     <p>The other Note is taken <hi>à poſteriore,</hi> from that which followes forgiveneſſe. For as there is a great difference in man before and after the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes; ſo the providence of God concerning him is farre different. In temporall goods there is a wide difference: ſeeing to a ſinner they are given onely out of Gods firſt or generall love (whereof a man may taſt deeply and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come neare the kingdome of heaven; yea the more of this is afforded to him, if he be not thereby brought to repentance, the greater ſhall his condemnation be:) but to him that hath obtained remiſſion of ſins, they are given out of Gods ſecond or ſpeciall love in Chriſt unto ſalvation. Yet can not any Note be taken from hence, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64461:28"/>theſe things are given indifferently to the good and bad; yea for the moſt part wicked men have herein the greateſt ſhare. And for the manner and intent of giving them (wherein the whole difference is) it can not be known by us, unleſſe we firſt know that our ſinnes are forgiven. But in ſpiritualls the very actions themſelves in the ſubſtance of them differ. For ſinners by the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God have their minds daily more and more blinded, and their hearts hardened: the aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit (whereby infirmities ſhould be helped and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons repreſſed) after long reſiſting and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the motions of it, is more withdrawn: yea they going on ſtill in notorious ſins are at laſt delivered over to a reprobate mind and ſtrong deluſion, to the luſts of their owne hearts and the power of Satan. But they who have their ſinnes forgiven, though they may have their relapſes ſometimes, as David and others had, yet for the generall courſe of their life they grow in grace; perhaps not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly every houre, day &amp;c. (<hi>Mar.</hi> 4.27.) yet ſo as conſidering how it is with them now, and how it was ſome while agoe, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that they are grown. The Holy Spirit more and more enlightens their eyes, purges their hearts, and makes them fit for every
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64461:29"/>good work, comforts them in adverſity, helps them in temptations &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo we have a ground of a double exhortation.<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> 1 To ſeek forgiveneſſe of our ſins at Gods hands.</p>
                     <p>Motive. 1 Without this a man is in a moſt miſerable condition, worſe then never to have been born, as being liable to the wrath of God, to the dominion of ſin and the devil, to all kinds of puniſhments. 2 On the other ſide, the forgiveneſſe of ſins hath bleſſedneſſe annexed to it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.) which imports the removall of all evil, and the obtaining of all good. 3 None can forgive ſins but God onely.</p>
                     <p>Meanes. 1 Chriſt the principall, as Who hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited and procured forgiveneſſe for ſuch as ſeek it through Him. His blood is the fountain of all remiſſion. 2 That we may obtain forgiveneſſe by Chriſt, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us 1 Repentance, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.47. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.31. On the contrary they that remain in their ſins without repentance, have no portion in the remiſſion of ſinnes. 2 Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. For true repentance is never ſeparated from true faith in Chriſt. Hence the Apoſtle ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beats upon Juſtification by faith. 3 New
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64461:29"/>obedience and amendment of life; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. For this cannot be ſeparated either from true repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. or from true faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When we have obtained forgiveneſſe, 1 To be thankfull to God, Who hath moſt freely and graciouſly beſtowed ſo excellent a benefit upon us. Now thankfulneſſe or thankſgiving is partly internall, partly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. The internall proceeds from the underſtanding acknowledging this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite benefit, and the heart fervently loving the Authour of it. The externall conſiſts 1 In words, when we ſeaſonably and ſincerely praiſe the benefit and the Benefactors, as in this Pſalme, and <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.8. &amp;c. 2 In deeds, namely (ſeeing we are not able to render any thing to God, which He any way needs, or which, if good, proceeds not firſt from Him the Authour and giver of all good things) in referring this benefit to its due end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To forgive our brethren, as God hath forgiven us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                     <p>Motiv. The argument holds from the greater to the leſſe in many reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the object of the forgiveneſs, our offenſes againſt God, and our brethrens
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64461:30"/>againſt us a between which there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon either for number or weight. 1 For number, the offenſes even of the beſt men are innumerable. For whereas the Scripture calls ſome men juſt, upright, perfect &amp;c. it ſpeaks of perfection of parts, not degrees; comparatively (in reference to men not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or newly converted) not ſimply; in reſpect of ſome particular action, not of their whole converſation; evangelically, not legally &amp;c. Which appeares plainly by other evident places of Scripture, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.36. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. And if this be our condition, when we are at the beſt in this life; what is it whileſt we are yet carnall, ſold under ſinne? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Job</hi> 15.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. to the 19. How few therefore are the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our brethren againſt us, if compared with the numberleſſe number of ours againſt God! 2 For the weight or greatneſſe of an offenſe (ſeeing evil ſtrictly taken is a mere privation, not a being) it is eſtimated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſſe of the good to which it is oppoſite. Our offenſes then being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infinite Majeſty of God, our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns againſt us but againſt duſt and aſhes like themſelves, what are theſe in compariſon of thoſe? Surely lighter then vanity, leſſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64461:30"/>then nothing. Which will yet more appear, if we take in all aggravating circumſtances; eſpecially the ingratitude of our ſinnes againſt God, more then can be imagined in any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of one man againſt another. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in His Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. ſets forth this compariſon between our ſinnes againſt God and our brethrens or fellow-ſervants offenſes againſt us, both in the number and greatneſſe, under the ſimilitude of 10000 talents, v. 24. and 100 pence, ver. 28. For greatneſſe, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to pence (one talent containing 6000 pence) For number 10000 to 100. that is, a hundred to one. Put both together, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the one above the other is ſix hundred thouſand fold. Which, though it be a vaſt diſparity, yet is but a ſhadow of the truth in the reddition, and comes infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of it. Now if our offenſes againſt God ſo far exceed our brethrens offenſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, both for number and weight, and yet God ſo graciouſly forgives us; how much more reaſon is it that we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our brethren?</p>

But here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that theſe mens ignorance of their diſeaſe is invincible, they can not help it: but thoſe we ſpeak of, are ignorant of their eſtate either affectedly, or of extreme negligence, which can neither excuſe nor be excuſed. For if they would examine themſelves by the Scriptures (as they might &amp; ought to do) they would eaſily diſcerne, if not ſtraightway all, yet many of their diſeaſes, and the reſt by degrees. Which becauſe they doe not, their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64461:34"/>condition is farre worſe then theirs, to whom we liken them; not onely becauſe the death and deſtruction of the ſoule, whereof they are in danger, is far worſe then that of the body, but alſo becauſe they are in more danger of it. For they who are bodily ſick, by how much the leſſe ſenſible they are of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe themſelves, have their friends ſo much the more ſolicitous for them: and the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick which is adminiſtred to them, (though they deſire it not, neither perceive when they take it) working by the naturall vertue which God hath put into herbs &amp;c. may reſtore them to their health. But they who are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſick and yet wilfully refuſe to know or acknowledge it, can not whileſt they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, receive any good by ſpirituall phyſick, neither will Chriſt the great Phyſician of ſouls take in hand to cure them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.30, 31, 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such as daily caſt their ſoules into new diſeaſes. There are two principall means of preſerving health and preventing diſeaſes, <hi>Diet</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> But for the <hi>former</hi> (as it is <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1.) many ſo feed themſelves with vain and impious principles not onely ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative but practicall, that thereby the mind and heart and whole man fall into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and great diſtempers. Some eat the bread of wickedneſſe and drink the wine of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64461:35"/>violence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. &amp; 4.17. Some eat the bread of deceit, which is ſweet at the firſt taſting, but afterwards fills the mouth with gravell, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. Some ſwallow down riches ill gotten, which prove the gall of aſpes within them, <hi>Job</hi> 20.14, 15. Some by oppreſſion ſwallow up the needy, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.4. And is it any wonder, if ſuch diet breed diſeaſes? So for <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> many giving themſelves to ſpirituall idleneſſe altogether neglect the exerciſes of piety; and ſo both of themſelves contract abundance of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and alſo give the devil opportunity to infect their ſouls with his temptations, yea tempt him to it.

                     <p>Motiv. 1. From the worth and price of the ſoul the ſubject of theſe diſeaſes. 2 From the great and imminent danger wherein it is by reaſon of them. 3 From the difficulty of overcoming them. 4 From the poſſibility (notwithſtanding) of doing it in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſure by the power of Gods grace.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Wherein this healing conſiſts. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſaid of <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> ſo (there being the ſame reaſon of contraries) <hi>healing</hi> alſo [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] bath for its proper ſubject the body naturall ill affected by ſome diſeaſe or wound; but by Metaphor it may be transferred to other things alſo. For as in the proper ſenſe he is ſaid to heale, who takes away that which hinders the health of the body ſo in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall, he who takes away from any thing that which hinders the well being of it.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64461:36"/>So 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.2. And thus it is often transferred to the ſoule: though here the ſimilitude holds not in every point. For in the body, nature being freed from the noxious humour doth of it ſelf breed good blood, and ſupply it to the repairing the ſtrength of the whole impaired by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But in the ſoule after lapſe, there is no power to any ſaving good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How this healing is wrought: Namely by the Spirit of God uſing the Word and Sacraments. It is the work of the Spirit of God, Who is therefore called Holy, becauſe He ſanctifies the faithfull, and this work of healing is a part of ſanctification. But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not effect this without us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. That therefore we may be fitted for this work, the Spirit uſeth the word, which is compared to a <hi>medicine, Prov.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. The Spirit therfore by the word and with the word 1 ſhewes us our diſeaſes. 2 moves the will to ſeek to be healed, by diſſwaſives from remaining under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, and perſwaſives to holineſſe. 3 directs the action. It uſeth alſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which we are united unto Chriſt, (Baptiſm for initiation, the Euchariſt for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe) and ſo we are gathered (as ſometimes He would have gathered the children of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64461:37"/>under his wings, <hi>wherein is healing, Mal.</hi> 4.2. Yea the Sacraments, ſealing the great benefits of God to us, and our duty toward Him, do both encourage us to ſeek healing, and afford moſt effectuall arguments to move us to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 How farre. In all that truly repent and beleeve, God heales all diſeaſes, but not ſtraightway perfectly, nor in all equally, but by different degrees. For the Scripture makes 3 diſtinct degrees of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 1 Beginners, who are called <hi>Children uſing milk, Hebr.</hi> 5.12, 13. 2 Proficients, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14, 15. 3 Perfect or ſtrong men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. But in all true beleevers this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is ſo farre made, as to take away the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, and that it may not hinder their ſalvation; and in none perfectly or in every point in this life.

                     <p>Two things we are here to be exhorted to.<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> 1 In reſpect of our ſelves, To flee unto God for protection from both kinds of death.</p>
                     <p>Motiv. 1 In reſpect of the <hi>objectum quod,</hi> the deliverance it ſelf which we ſeek. 1 We ſtand in great need of it, in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers both bodily and ſpirituall, to which we are lyable. 2 The good or benefit of it is as great; whereof ſomething ſhall be ſaid in the Reaſon of the next Doctrine. 2 In reſpect of the <hi>objectum per quod,</hi> the means whereby we muſt be delivered. 1 No creature can do it but as Gods inſtrument. 2 God, even without the help of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is able to do it. 3 If we rightly ſeek
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64461:45"/>to Him, He will moſt readily deliver us both from temporall death, ſo farre as ſhall be expedient, and from eternall death ſimply and abſolutely.</p>
                     <p>Meanes. That we may rightly expect any thing from God, it is required of us, 1 That we be ſuch as by the tenour of the covenant have part in Gods promiſes. 2 That we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently doe thoſe things which on our part are to be done in order thereunto, viz. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our affairs providently (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.7.) recommend our ſelves to God by prayer, faſting &amp;c. 3 That we ſeek Gods delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances (as all His other benefits) in their due manner and order; that is, ſpirituall and eternall things chiefly and abſolutely, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things moderately and with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods will.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In reſpect of others, To procure their deliverance as much as in us lies; that ſo we may be like unto God, and according to our ability promote his work. Not that He, Who is omnipotent, ſtands in need of our help, but that He requires of us to love our brethren, and by this means to teſtifie our love. We muſt therefore endeavour to deliver them 1 From bodily or temporall death. For if he who is in danger of it, be a good man he is deare to God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64461:46"/>and God tenders him as the apple of His own eye. Therefore our concurrence herein will be acceptable to God, and honourable to our ſelves: alſo profitable unto others, whom a good man, whileſt he lives here, is continually exciting to glorifie God, both by his example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. and by his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhortations &amp;c. and beſides is beneficiall to them in temporall things alſo, by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; other endeavours keeping off evils and procuring good things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 19.21, 29. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23.

That a long life (whereby death comes upon us not ſuddenly and unexpectedly, but maturely and according to the ordinary courſe of nature) may lawfully (with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Gods will) be deſired, abundantly appeares by what hath been ſaid in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Doctrine, and ſufficiently by this act of David here. For thankſgiving right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered (as we muſt ſuppoſe it here to be) alwaies implies the cauſe of it to be ſome benefit or good thing; which therefore being abſent may lawfully at leaſt be deſired.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is cleare, that our deliverance from eternall deſtruction, much more our eternall happineſſe in heaven, is of Gods free grace, not of the merit of our works (which is oppoſed to grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.) for there
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64461:48"/>is no thanks due but for a benefit freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.9.</p>
                     <p>Here are reproved 1 They that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull to God for their redemption or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive from bodily death.<note place="margin">Repr.</note> Such muſt they needs be, who doe not acknowledge it to be received from God: for the firſt degree of gratitude, is to acknowledge the benefactour. But much more unthankfull are they, who, when God hath delivered them from any ſickneſſe, employ their recovered health and ſtrength to ſinne againſt Him. Such men ſhew plainly that they think their life ſerves onely for the ſatisfying of their luſts, as if they were born for none other end but to ſinne: and therefore having been hindred in their buſineſſe by ſickneſſe, as ſoon as they are recovered, they double their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the regaining that time. And this is ſtill ſo much the worſe, when done after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and vowes of amendment. Oh what ſaints do ſome men ſeeme upon their ſick beds, when they think themſelves in danger of death! How do they blame their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſes! What promiſes do they make for the future, if God ſhall reſtore them to health! But being recovered, no ſuch matter appears. With the dog they return to their vomit: the courſes, which they ſo diſliked
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64461:49"/>in their ſickneſſe, they ruſh into again, as the horſe into the battell. Againſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment then promiſed they beare an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in reſpect of their luſts anew urging them to their old courſes, and of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who would hate them, if reformed.

High time it is then for ſuch to recount what vowes they have made in their diſtreſſe, and ſpeedily to go about the performance of them. Otherwiſe let them make account to beare the puniſhment not only of unthankfulneſſe, as the former, but moreover of breaking vowes; and thoſe not of things indifferent (which yet God will ſtrictly require) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame with, or branches of their vowes formerly made in Baptiſme. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, Dent.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4.

But we need not goe ſo farre, the Scripture it ſelf having many paſſages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vigour of the eagle.

                     <p n="1">1 The perſons oppreſſed are commonly (as was ſhewed before) the poore, needy, ſtrangers, orphanes, and ſuch like miſerable and helpleſſe perſons: whom to oppreſſe is a violation not onely of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, but of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> alſo. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Mica.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. From ſuch even to take to pawn any thing of daily uſe (eſpecially if it be not timely reſtored) is a ſinne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26, 27. <hi>Job</hi> 24.3. Yea not to give to ſuch is damnable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. &amp;c. How farre therefore is it from the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to oppreſſe ſuch? The puniſhment hereof is deſcribed in generall <hi>Job</hi> 31.21, 22, 23. More particularly here God delights to render like for like; that both the oppreſſours themſelves and all the world beſide may ſee, both that it is His hand, and that His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64461:65"/>is juſt. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22, 23, 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. ver. 9, 10, 11, 12. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ver. 16. So in the negative, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours refuſe to heare the voice of God and the poore, God alſo in like manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to heare their voice when they cry unto Him in their miſery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. But of all that can be ſaid or thought, that is the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.22, 23. where the ſpoilers ſhall be ſpoiled, not onely of outward things by men (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1.) but of their precious ſoules by God. There may be many other aggravating circumſtances in the perſons oppreſſed; as in reſpect of their innocence, piety, ſacredneſſe, uſefulneſſe to the publique, relation to or well deſerving of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours &amp;c. But I inſtance in that which is moſt generall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The perſons oppreſſing are commonly (as Saint James obſerves cha. 2.6.) the rich and great men of the world; at leaſt, great in compariſon of the oppreſſed, as was ſaid before. Which gives a double aggravation to the ſinne. 1 In that they do it not for any need (though no need ſhould make a man ſinne) but either of extreame covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of pride, malice, envy, or of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton cruelty, or ſome ſuch like devilliſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64461:66"/>2 In that their wealth, power, greatneſſe &amp;c which God hath given them to this end, that they might therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, relieve, and do good to the poore, they abuſe to the quite contrary purpoſe, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, robbery, and oppreſſion, and that of the poore.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, if baſe and mean men get the power into their hands to oppreſſe the great, rich, noble, and honourable; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be, and commonly is, in other reſpects yet farre worſe on both ſides.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the perſons oppreſſed it is greater, both becauſe the ſubject matter, or that whereof they are ſpoiled, is greater, and becauſe ſuch perſons being reduced from one extreame to the other muſt needs be more ſenſible of it: And beſide, they being by their education, experience, places &amp;c more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to glorifie God, and do ſervice to the publique, are hereby diſabled to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In reſpect of the oppreſſours, as it is more againſt nature and order (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.5.) ſo it is commonly more inſolent and cruell, and more contemptuous and deſpitefull to the perſons oppreſſed. <hi>Aſperius nihil eſt &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for them,<note place="margin">Conſol.</note> who either in themſelves, or in thoſe that are near and dear unto them,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64461:66"/>are either already under oppreſsion, or at leaſt in imminent danger of it, here is abundant comfort, and armour of proof againſt all thoſe afflicting and tormenting paſſions of <hi>feare, griefe, anger, envy, deſpaire, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp;c. Feare</hi> or dread of what they may ſuffer, <hi>grief</hi> or ſorrow for what they ſuffer, <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> againſt the authours of their ſuffrings (their oppreſſours) <hi>deſpaire</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience</hi> in reſpect of the continuance of their ſuffrings. Againſt all theſe it is enough to oppoſe as a full and ſufficient ground of comfort the Doctrine here in hand, <hi>That the Lord executes righteouſneſſe and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all that are oppreſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And 1 for <hi>Feare</hi> ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46.1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 56.3, 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 118.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. For what though they, who threaten to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, be mighty? The Lord that dwels on high is mightier: though they be crafty, He is wiſer, and can take them in their own craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe: though they be unjuſt, He is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: though they be cruell, He is mercifull. His Power and Wiſdome make Him able, His Juſtice and Mercy make Him willing to performe what David here affirms of Him. Therefore though the feare, whereby we draw nigh to Him for protection, and uſe all honeſt meanes for our ſafety (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64461:67"/>be lawfull and commendable: yet ſo to fear men as not to truſt in God, or (which is worſe) ſo to fear men as not to fear God, or to feare men more then God, and ſo to comply with them (affirmatively or negatively) in things diſpleaſing to God, for feare of being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them, this is utterly unlawfull and unreaſonable. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.26, 28, 31, 33. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For them, who are already under oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; ſo in <hi>grief,</hi> ſorrow or heavineſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the comfort is the ſame: God, Who ſees all their ſuffrings and hears their grones, yea Who as it were ſuffers together with them, &amp; is afflicted in all their affliction, He will take the matter into His own hand and <hi>execute righteouſneſſe for them.</hi> Their right, though oppreſſed for the preſent, yet is not dead but ſleeps: God can and will aſſuredly revive and reſtore it to them again with advantage, either in kind, or in that which is of better va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, ſo that they ſhall loſe nothing by the hand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 As this ſhould moderate their ſorrow and grief in reſpect of themſelves or their friends, who are oppreſſed; ſo, much more ſhould it refrain and quiet thoſe more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions of <hi>anger, envy,</hi> and (as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of both) <hi>deſire of revenge</hi> againſt their oppreſſours. For this is Gods part: He <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64461:67"/>judgement</hi> againſt oppreſſours, as well as righteouſneſs for the oppreſſed. <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord, Rom.</hi> 12.19. It is <hi>mine,</hi> not <hi>thine;</hi> &amp; therefore thou oughteſt not to revenge thy ſelf: And, <hi>I will repay;</hi> therefore <hi>thou needeſt not.</hi> And woe to thoſe oppreſſours that ſhall fall into Gods hands. If we conſider the danger they are in, we had need to pity and pray for them, that God would forgive them and turn their hearts. But if they ſhall ſtill perſiſt in their ſinne, yet however let us quietly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our cauſe to God, and reſt aſſured, that as we ſhall be no loſers, ſo our enemies ſhall be no gainers by oppreſſing us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And laſtly, if by reaſon of the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the oppreſſions that ly upon us, we be tempted either altogether to <hi>deſpaire</hi> of reliefe, as though it would never come (which is contrary to the prime act of faith and hope) or at leaſt to be <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,</hi> as thinking it too long in coming, and ſo to ſay with him 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. <hi>What ſhould I wait for the LORD any longer?</hi> (which is contrary to that act or effect of faith and hope, that is called <gap reason="foreign">

This our condition (I ſay) that we are altogether abſent from Gods glorious preſence, and from His gracious preſence (in reſpect of the fruits of his ſecond love) totally before our regeneration, and in part even to the end of our life, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hence, viz. in that there needs <hi>a way</hi> to lead us unto Him; which needed not, if we were already preſent with Him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such is the love of God to mankind, that He hath not left us in this miſery deſtitute of all hope, but hath made known unto us His waies, which will moſt certainly and directly

                     <p n="3">3 See part of that depth <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. viz. that in the time of the Old Teſtament God out of all nations choſe the Iſraelites (whoſe Doctor or teacher was Moſes) to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people unto Himſelf <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.14, 15.

                     <p n="4">4 Behold our privilege above the old Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.

Who coming forth out of the boſome of His Father (where He was admitted to the moſt intimate knowledge

                     <p>And if Gods word be His way,<note place="margin">Repr.</note> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are much out of the way, who ſo live as if there were no word of God at all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they ought to walk.

What? do they think there is no word of God at all preſcribing men their duties? But the text here demonſtrates the contrary. Doe they pretend ignorance of it? But that excuſe will help no man; ſeeing God both in Adam after the fall, and in Noah revealed the word
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64461:72"/>of His grace unto all, denies the word to no people or man, but either for their own or their forefathers ſinnes, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11.

                     <p>But let us be exhorted to acquaint our ſelves with, and guide our ſelves by the waies of God in all the parts thereof.</p>
                     <p>Motiv. 1 It is ſimply neceſſary for us (unleſſe we will be eternally miſerable) to enjoy Gods gracious (according to His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond love) and glorious preſence. 2 Onely the waies of God lead us thereunto. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther journeys though a man erre from the right way, yet he may come to the place he intended by ſome other way, though leſſe compendiouſly. But unleſſe we inſiſt in the waies preſcribed by God, it is impoſsible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come unto Him. For all other waies (though for the preſent one be much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from another) at laſt meet in the broad way of deſtruction. 3 He that undertakes an earthly journey, may be in the right way and yet ignorant of it. But ſo we cannot be in Gods waies: if we doe not know our ſelves to be in the way, we are certainly out of it. It is a part of Gods waies, to know
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64461:73"/>His waies; God requiring of us, not onely that we walk according to his preſcript for the ſubſtance of our actions, but that we doe it out of certain knowledge that He hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it: otherwiſe we walk not of faith, and therefore ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Meanes. 1 For preparation, Come 1 with humble reverence in reſpect of God, Who makes known His waies. 2 With a firme purpoſe and reſolution to beleeve whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Scripture teacheth, to performe and omit whatſoever it commands and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For the more immediate actions, After Gods bleſſing implored, 1 Read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures privately, meditate upon them, and as occaſion is offered, conferre thereabout with others. 2 Seeing private perſons can not herein do much without ſome man to guide them (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.31.) the knowledge and underſtanding of the Scriptures is to be ſought at the prieſts mouth (<hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7.) 1 by attending to him in the publique preaching. 2 by conſulting him private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as need and opportunity ſhall be.</p>

And ſo for ſalvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith</hi> &amp;c. Yea <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace</hi> &amp;c. For it is of the mere grace of God, that He would make a new covenant; that omitting the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Law He would require Faith for the condition of it; that we are either able or willing to beleeve, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. Theſe two therefore may very well ſtand together, That all who are juſtifyed and ſaved are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed and ſaved of the mere grace of God, and yet, That no man is juſtifyed or ſaved but by Faith. God doth not enter cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, as needing any thing that we can do unto Him. Who is in Himſelf All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and Bleſſed from everlaſting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting. He doth not enter covenant with us, as thereby to cut off that abſolute right of creation and redemption, in regard of which He might require of us whatſoever we could performe, without making any promiſe to us, or covenanting thereby for our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. His covenant is ſo framed, that He commands what we are to doe, and adds a terrible threatning of death, if we doe it not,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64461:83"/>and promiſes a reward as of grace and free gift, if we doe it: we tender the condition to Him from His own power, as our duty, and ſeek the reward by humble intreaty, that He would remember His holy covenant. So that he enters into covenant, to excite us the more willingly and cheerfully to doe Him ſervice; not to imply that He needs to us, or that we can merit any thing at His hands.</p>

                     <p>For our inſtruction,<note place="margin">Inſtr.</note> 1 Here we ſee whence it is that God often plentifully beſtowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wicked men the good things whereof they are moſt unworthy, and averts the evils which they have moſt juſtly deſerved; though out of His Omniſciency He moſt certainly foreſees their obſtinacy to be ſuch that they will not by theſe riches of His goodneſſe be led to repentance. Hereupon ſome of the heathen denyed Gods providence, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times holy men envy the wicked. But we may eaſily reſiſt theſe temptations. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (of the heathen) if we think of the grace of God, which looks at neither antecedent merit nor ſubſequent recompenſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64461:84"/>of good or averting of evil, and out of which He will doe good even to bad men, that He may ſatisfie His love to His creature, though He certainly foreſee that (by reaſon of their contumacy) He ſhall not obteine his prime end of bringing them to repentance, which He ſeriouſly intends, and for which He uſeth ſufficient meanes. The other tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (of the ſaints) we may alſo reſiſt 1 If we conſider the ſame grace of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He may doe with His own what He will (For <hi>is it not lawfull for Him ſo to doe? Is our eye evil, becauſe He is good?</hi>) 2 If we conſider how long He ſo deales with the wicked of His grace: Not for ever, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo long as He thinks fit to expect their converſion. But if they will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted but turne His grace into wantonneſſe; the Spirit of grace, to which they doe ſuch deſpite, will not alwaies ſtrive with them, but there will be a time, when, ſtripping them of all good, God will caſt them into eternall miſery, ſo that it ſhall be manifeſt to all, that they are nothing leſſe then the object of envy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 See here a juſt and effectuall cauſe of patience when either good things are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or evils ly upon us. If we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or God did any way ow us the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64461:84"/>of thoſe good things or the averting of thoſe evils, it were another matter. But ſeeing He is <hi>gracious</hi> diſpenſing all His bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits <hi>freely,</hi> why do we yet complaine as if He dealt injuriouſly with us? Yea rather let us ſet in order before our ſelves our many and great ſinnes, and amongſt the reſt our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing of Gods benefits; and then I dare boldly ſay we are very blind, if we do not ſee moſt juſt cauſe of acknowledging the great grace of God toward us, that any good at all, even our life and breath, is ſtill continued to us, and that we are not at this very houre in hell. And further we muſt conſider that Gods withholding temporall good things, or His ſending temporall evils, do not alwaies proceed from an intention of revenge, neither are as it were forerunners of condemnation; but, that He often even of the ſame <hi>grace</hi> fatherly chaſtiſes us for our good, yea many times onely proves us, that His graces may be exerciſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in us, that ſo He may enlarge His bleſſings upon us in this life, and in the life to come ſet a more ſhining crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon our heads. Seeing then that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of both theſe kinds proceed from the <hi>grace</hi> of God, and are unſpeakably profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us; ſhall we be ſo mad as to be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64461:85"/>vexed at our own great good, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient againſt God for being <hi>gracious</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 See alſo a ſoveraigne remedy againſt pride and boaſting of any good thing we have. For what have we that we have not received, not onely without but contrary to our merit, of the mere <hi>grace</hi> of God? And if we have ſo received it, why ſhould we boaſt our ſelves as if we had not received it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 See a juſt reaſon why the Scripture ſo often requires of us thankfulneſſe to God for all His benefits. If we did deſerve them, there were no thanks due to God; as doing but that, which in juſtice He were bound to doe. But ſeeing He is <hi>gracious,</hi> diſpenſing His benefits freely without any deſert on our part; our thanks (which would be due e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a man, that ſhould beſtow any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit upon us) muſt needs be moſt due unto Him.</p>
                     <p>This reproves 1 Such as abuſe the <hi>grace</hi> of God.<note place="margin">Repr.</note> God indeed is <hi>gracious:</hi> But will He ſo give all things to all men? Indeed He is willing and ready to give unto all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch conditions as are agreeable to the honour of His juſtice; and He doth often give plentifully the things of this life and the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64461:85"/>meanes of ſalvation to wicked men. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſalvation He will not give to any (I ſpeak of them who are <hi>adulti</hi> and have the uſe of reaſon) but onely to true beleevers, as appeares manifeſtly every where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Them that will not reward ſuch as by taking paines for the good of their ſoules, bodies, or eſtates, deſerve it in the ſtrict ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of juſtice. How unlike are theſe to God, Who gives His rewards to thoſe that no way deſerve them? And with what face can they expect ſuch a reward of <hi>grace,</hi> who will not give a reward of <hi>debt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Much more thoſe who unjuſtly by fraud or violence take away a mans own from him, or requite evil for good.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide here is again a further ground of Comfort for them who grone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of their ſinnes,<note place="margin">Conſol.</note> doubting of obtaining forgiveneſſe and ſalvation. If there were no remiſſion to be had without works of ſatisfaction done either plenarily or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of temporall puniſhments (which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the papiſts affirme in the Councell of Trent Seſs. 4. cap. 8, 9.) we might well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed doubt of it, confidering on the one part the enormity of ſinne and the infiniteneſſe of Gods Majeſty offended thereby, and on the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64461:86"/>other part our own weakneſſe. But God is <hi>gracious,</hi> and forgives ſinnes (if truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of according to the preſcript of His Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell) <hi>freely.</hi> And though He may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome ſinnes retaine the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (as in Moſes <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.48. &amp;c. and in David 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13, 14.) this is not, that ſatisfaction might be made Him (Whom Chriſt hath fully ſatisfyed) but to humble them, with whom He ſo deales, and make them beware for the time to come, and to admoniſh others by their example &amp;c. So for ſalvation, if it depended upon our own merits, we might caſt away all hopes and thoughts of it. But God is <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> and, <hi>by grace we are ſaved</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8) as many as are ſaved. Therefore if we frame our ſelves carefully after the rule of the Goſpell, our ſalvation according to the covenant of grace is moſt certain.</p>
                     <p>Let this exhort us 1 To come to the throne of grace.<note place="margin">Exhort.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Motiv. 1. We need many things. 2 With God is all ſufficiency. 3. From God ſitting upon the throne of <hi>Juſtice</hi> (as it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed to <hi>Grace</hi>) nothing can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by us but the wages of ſinne. 4 At the throne of <hi>grace</hi> all things, which are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good for us, may eaſily be obteined;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64461:86"/>where neither merit is prerequired, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe looked for at our hands, but God (as a debtour to no man, and ſtanding in need of nothing) gives all things <hi>freely.</hi> 5 God not onely admits them that come, but of his own accord invites them that are ſlack, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.</p>
                     <p>Meanes. That is ſimply <hi>neceſſary</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantly <hi>ſufficient,</hi> whereupon the Apoſtle grounds this exhortation in the place now quoted, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.16. viz. that (as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15.) we have Jeſus Chriſt for our High Prieſt to make interceſſion for us in the Holy of Holies. To this end we muſt attend to Him as a Prophet teaching us, and obey Him as a King commanding us to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and to bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhewing the truth of our faith by a ſerious and conſtant endeavour of <hi>denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. This meanes is abſolutely <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe God according to the preſcript of His wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for preſerving the honour of His ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, hath peremptorily decreed not to give the grace of ſalvation unto any but ſuch as are engraffed into Chriſt. And it is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſufficient,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath ſo ſatisfyed Gods Juſtice, that nothing hinders but that He may according to the naturall inclination
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64461:87"/>of His Grace moſt tenderly love all thoſe who are partakers of Him, and doe good to them in all things whereof they ſtand in need: which that He will alſo doe, His promiſes every where, oath, ſeales &amp;c. doe aſſure us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Freely to doe good to others. To imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God here in all points we are neither bound nor able. To ſome men we are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, as to our parents, creditours, benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours &amp;c. Many things alſo we our ſelves have need of; and therefore if we ſhould doe all things freely without expectation of recompenſe, we ſhould be deſtitute of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes of life. In which reſpect God commands that the labourer ſhould have his wages, and that they, who preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſhould live of the Goſpell; and in like manner, that all who exerciſe any lawfull calling ſhould be maintained thereby: which could not be, if a labourer ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his paines, and a tradeſman ſhould give away his commodities &amp;c. But ſo farre as other mens neceſſities require, and our own abilities will beare, we ought to doe it.</p>
                     <p>Motiv. 1 To requite them that have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, or to give to them who are like to requite us, is a ſmall matter: publicanes

Let the papiſts therefore with their will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip goe to their he and ſhe ſaints: but let us goe to God with our prayers, as both His commandement layes a neceſſity upon us,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64461:90"/>and this Attribute abundantly encourages us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 See the fountain of all good; whence both what we have is received, and what we want is to be ſought.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If God be ſo plenteous in loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe even towards all; how much more towards His children!</p>

                     <p>This reproves 1 Such as ſeek the good things they deſire,<note place="margin">Repr.</note> from any other then from God. Theſe are like unto them <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>they commit two evils &amp;c.</hi> For whereas every tranſgreſſion of the law is ſinne, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe two waies at once. Which their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion (as all ſinnes are not equall) ſee 1 how impious it is. 2 how unprofitable and fooliſh. 1 For the impiety, the degree of it (which for the ſubſtance is to be eſtimated by the Commandement which is violated) is very great: becauſe it is againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the firſt Table which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſpects God Himſelf, and ſo the violation of it, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is worſe then the violation of any of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Table, which reſpect our neighbour. And whereas the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64461:91"/>of the firſt Table concerns the having of the true God (as the reſt the true manner of worſhipping Him) therefore the breach of that is moſt hainous. See the ſtory of the Samaritanes 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. God ſent lions againſt them that did not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him, ver. 25. but with-held them from thoſe that worſhipped Him though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jeroboams manner. Now whereas the firſt commandement enjoines the having of the Lord for our God, and forbids other gods; theſe men violate both parts of it, the affirmative by <hi>forſaking the Lord,</hi> the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by <hi>digging themſelves other ciſternes.</hi> For Truſt is an act eminently due onely to God, and not to be placed in any thing elſe but with ſubordination unto Him: And therefore in what thing ſoever a man princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally truſts, that he makes his god. 2 How unprofitable and fooliſh this is, appeares by the deſcription of God and theſe ciſternes. God is <hi>the fountain of living waters:</hi> The ciſternes, which they dig, as (being but <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes,</hi> not <hi>fountaines</hi>) they have no water of themſelves, ſo (being but <hi>broken ciſternes</hi>) they can not hold the water that is put into them to ſupply thoſe that dig them. For all creatures as they are from God, ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Him for their operation, yea and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64461:91"/>for the continuance of their being: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſſe they be preſerved by God, and enabled by Him, it is impoſſible they ſhould help us. Now He will be ſo farre from bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the creatures wherein men idolatrouſly truſt, that He curſes thoſe that truſt in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. and many times takes away and deſtroyes the creatures themſelves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such as are unlike to God 1 Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, ſuch as either through their own fault have not ſpirituall or temporall good things wherewith to profit others or who having them are not ready to communicate them. 2 Poſitively, ſuch as are plenteous in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſneſſe; who are ſo much worſe then the former, by how much commiſſion of ill is worſe then omiſſion of good, which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it ſelf and ſuperadds to it.</p>

                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:64461:92"/> 2 Much more the godly. For if God be ſo plenteous in loving kindneſſe to men, whileſt they are yet His enemies; how much more when they are reconciled to Him, and become His friends and His children, whom He tenders as the apple of His eye, more then a mother her ſucking child? Can we think that Jacob feared the famine after he knew there was come enough in Egypt, and the diſpoſall thereof in the power of his ſon Joſeph? Yet among men love deſcends, ſo that the love of a ſonne toward his father, is not equall to that of a father toward his children: and the love of any earthly father whatſoever is nothing to the love of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father; whether we conſider the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, or the conſtancy, or the efficacy of it. Of how little faith therefore are we, if ſo great kindneſſe of ſo loving a Father can not comfort us againſt any grief or feare whatſoever!</p>
                     <p>Let this alſo exhort us 1 For the good things we yet have not,<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> to expect and ſeek them of Gods loving kindneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For thoſe we have already received, to be thankfull to Him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To imitate God in this Attribute alſo as in the former.</p>
                     <p>Motiv. 1 The dignity of man conſiſts in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64461:92"/>being like unto God. Some courtiers have imitated even the imperfections of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in His bounty or loving kindneſſe: ſeeing, as it is more honourable in the eies of men, ſo it is a more bleſſed thing before God to give then to receive (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.35.) to be a help rather then a burden to others. 2 The good things we have, whether ſpirituall or temporall, are not our own, but are onely to be diſpenſed by us according to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.

And theſe 2 waies can not ſtand together, unleſſe we ſuppoſe the ſame perſons to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alike qualifyed. For if He follow the rule of the Goſpell, then He muſt carry Himſelf differently to men differently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: If He carry Himſelf alwaies alike to the ſame perſons, though differently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, then He doth not follow the rule of the Goſpell; for that requires a different carriage. Whether way then ſhall we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Gods immutability? To affirme the latter were to make God in His own nature (requiring that He ſhould follow the rule dictated by His Wiſdome, decreed by His Will, manifeſted by His word, confirmed by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64461:96"/>His oath &amp;c. and therefore that he ſhould not carry Himſelf alike to the ſame man at different times differently qualifyed, viz. penitent and impenitent) mutable, yea a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and perjured; and to caſt them, againſt whom He is angry, headlong into deſpaire, others into preſumption. And it is confuted as in infinite other places, ſo here, where we ſee God doth not alwaies keep His anger againſt thoſe at whom He is once angry. Yea it were unbefitting an earthly god (who ought conſtantly to be a terrour to them that doe evil, but for the praiſe of them that doe well) ſo to be either well or ill affected to any man, as to be ſtill the ſame to him, whether he doe well or ill, and ſo to reſpect the perſon of a man above juſtice. Wherefore the former immutability is that which the Scripture ſo often attributes to God, and ſo much celebrates; viz. that God without any reſpect of perſons is angry at the impenitent, and well pleaſed with them that repent. And thus He is, without any change at all in Himſelf; ſeeing His carriage onely (out of His immutable obſerving the rule of His covenant) is changed upon a change in the object. The fire hardens the clay, and ſoftens the waxe; not that there is any change or difference in the fire but in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

                     <p>Motiv. 1. We ſhall thereby remit not of juſtice (as God by breaking off His wrath) but of iniquity.

                     <p>Motiv. 1. Anger is a fruit of the fleſh (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.8.) which in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould never appear; or, if it do at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time break out, it is not to be retained. 2 Unles we break it off at the firſt, it will bring a world of evils. For by reaſon of the ſwiftnes and violence of its motion, it takes away the ultimate judgement of the reaſon (<hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.9.) and ſo at once both excites a man vehemently to act, and takes away the rule according to which he ought to act. 3 Anger being continued cauſes hatred or malice, which is farre worſe then anger. For Malice or hatred deſires <hi>malum alterius, quà malum,</hi> the evil of another as evil, and ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64461:98"/>infinitely: whereas Anger deſires it <hi>tanquam bonum honeſtum &amp; juſtum,</hi> under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good for juſt revenge; and that to a certaine meaſure, which being fulfilled, it reſts, being exceeded, it pities. Againe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deales plainly and openly, and ſo may the more eaſily be reſiſted: Hatred or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice goes cloſely and cunningly to work, and laies wait to doe miſchief, both <hi>diſſimulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> by concealing the ill it intends, and <hi>ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando,</hi> for a better colour pretending the contrary. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.24, 25. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.27. and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore His Wiſdome dictates, and His Free will determines, how and how farre both theſe Attributes are to be exerciſed. Amongſt men, juſtice requires that we doe injury to no man, either by deteining from him the good due, or by inflicting upon him the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64461:101"/>not due: but it requires not, that we ſhould not doe him more good, or inflict upon him leſſe evil then is due. He that withholds either totally or in part the good that is due, is unjuſt: but he that gives, over and above what is due, is not unjuſt, but bountifull. He that puniſheth an innocent man at all, or a nocent man beyond his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is unjuſt; but he that either puniſheth below the deſert, or totally remits an offenſe committed againſt himſelf, is not unjuſt, but clement and mercifull. And if this be ſo amongſt men, much leſſe may this liberty be denyed to God the ſupreme Lord of all. His juſtice requires that He ſhould not give leſſe then He hath promiſed (for having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed He becomes a debtour, though not to the creature, yet to Himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10.) but it is His bounty, not injuſtice, to give more then He hath promiſed. Again His juſtice ſuffers Him not to puniſh them that are innocent, nor yet ſinners beyond their merit: but to forgive ſinnes freely for Chriſts ſake, or not to deale with ſinners accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their iniquities, is not injuſtice, but mercy.<note place="margin">Repr.</note>

                     </gap> as it often ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies to frame a corporeall or bodily thing (as Adams body <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. the molten calf <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4. a pot or other veſſell, whereof a potter is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.) Laſtly, the ſcope of the place makes for it. For David (as we ſee) intends to render a reaſon from the miſery of man, why God mitigates His anger. Now the condition of the body in reſpect of the matter will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appeare by the latter member of the verſe: therefore that part of the reaſon will loſe none of the force or evidence, if this member be otherwiſe referred. And if it be referred to the ſoule, the reaſon will be more full; viz. that God mitigates His anger, not onely becauſe He remembers the frailty of the body, but alſo becauſe He knowes the ſtate of the ſoule, how prone men are in their minds to think ill, and in their hearts to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ill.

Yea Cains murther, &amp; whatſoever other ſinne hath been by any man committed ſince the beginning of the world, whereof he ſhall not have repented, God ſhall in the end of the world remember and puniſh as a righteous Judge. And therefore theſe alſo are ſayd to be written <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. Our ſinnes may be concealed from men, but God can not be deceived. We may forget our own ſinnes; but God will be ſure moſt perfectly to remember them, and hereafter, unleſſe we
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64461:123"/>repent, will ſet them in order before us. And both for good and evil deeds, if God ſhould forget any of them, we might ſay with Saint Paul <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. How ſhall He judge the world? How ſhould He bring every work to judgement with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil (<hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.14.) if He did not both know and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all our works both good and evil?</p>
                     <p>And if God remember that our bodies are duſt,<note place="margin">Repr.</note> why do we our ſelves forget it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we either on the one ſide too highly prize our bodies and too much pamper and trimme them; or on the other ſide are too litle ſparing of them, laying more upon them then duſt can beare, or not affording them ſuch neceſſaries as their frailty requires.</p>
                     <p>Yea let us ever remember,<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> and often actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recount with our ſelves what God here remembers, viz. <hi>That we all are duſt.</hi>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64461:123"/>with what reverence therefore had we need to come before Him? 2 It will beget in us a hatred of ſinne, as out of ſenſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo eſpecially becauſe it is ſo hatefull to God: both which are here manifeſt in that God for one onely ſin of Adam hath made us all duſt in this miſerable ſenſe. 3 It will make us carefull to ſearch our hearts and try our waies, vigilant againſt Satan and all occaſions of ſinning, and more diligent and conſtant in the uſe of the word, ſacraments, and all other meanes ſerving to ſtrengthen our ſoules. 4 Whereas no care can long preſerve the body from death, it will excite us ſo to live, that when the duſt ſhall be turned to the earth as it was, the ſpirit may with comfort return to God, Who gave it, in Him quietly reſting, and expecting a joyfull reſurrection of the body and reunion with it ſelf. 2 In reſpect of others, If we remember that they are duſt, 1 It will reſtraine us from envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proſperity of wicked men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 73.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 It will make us more favourable to them, who ſlip through infirmity. 3 It will make us not too much to truſt in humane helps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.22. 4 On the other ſide, not to feare the wrath and power of men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.7, 8, 12. 5 It will moderate our grief for
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64461:124"/>the death of our friends: For to him that conſiders all are duſt, it will not ſeem ſtrange that the duſt ſhould returne to duſt againe. So Anaxagoras when he had newes of the death of his ſonne, anſwered, <hi>Sciebam me genuiſſe mortalem, I knew that I begat him mortall.</hi> 6 It more ſpecially concernes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of families, that they ſhould not intreat their ſervants too hardly in impoſing of work, inflicting of correction, abbridging them of neceſſaries &amp;c. but afford them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient reſt, eſpecially on the Lords day, moderate their corrections according to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and clemency, and readily allow them all things neceſſary and convenient for them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.15, 21. Otherwiſe let them think they heare their ſervants complaining with Job (<hi>chap.</hi> 6.12.) <hi>Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh of braſſe,</hi> that I ſhould have ſo much buſineſſe and correction layd upon me, and ſo ſlender pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion afforded me? Let them alſo conſider and ſay of their ſervants as Job of his, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.15. <hi>Did not He, that made me in the wombe, make him?</hi> &amp;c. So S. Cyprian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Demetrianum, <hi>Domini &amp; ſervi eadem ſors naſcendi, conditio una moriendi, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum materia conſimilis, animarum ratio communis</hi> &amp;c.

And all theſe come down from the Father of lights, and are given unto men, partly that by enjoying them the many calamities of this pilgrimage may be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but chiefly, that they may glorify the Giver, promote their own ſalvation, benefit the Church, common-wealth, and particular perſons, by the rightuſe of theſe according to Gods word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When they moſt flouriſh, they are but <hi>like unto a flower,</hi> whoſe ſhort continuance and fading condition no man but knowes: And that to a flower not <hi>of the garden</hi> (which is much ſheltered from ſharp winds, fenced from the teeth and feet of beaſts, from the hands of children, ſtrangers &amp;c.) but <hi>of the field,</hi> which lies open to all inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.

But let us ſee what kind of ciſterns theſe men dig for themſelves: Certaine it is, that what ever they be, none of them can in this caſe hold any water. For they cannot make men to be other then like unto <hi>flowers,</hi> and thoſe <hi>of the field</hi> too; and therefore can not defend them from death. Yea as the flower is many times blaſted with the wind, or cropt by the hand of him that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by, when the graſſe remaines untouched: ſo theſe things many times expoſe thoſe, that have them, to greater dangers. To omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for brevities ſake, Let us ſee concerning riches, which men are moſt prone to truſt in, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.) becauſe they may thereby procure other men (and <hi>Vis unita fortior</hi>) to uſe their skill, ſtrength, care, (and what not?) for their help.

For what is the moſt beautifull face but a peece of red and white clay mixt together? And therefore beauty, even whileſt it remaines, is not much to be eſteemed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. is many times found in them that are none of the beſt, as in Cains poſterity <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. harlots <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.25. &amp;c.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64461:135"/>tells us that <hi>the mercy of God from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is to them that feare Him.</hi> Let us then ſee that we truely feare God, and conſtantly continue in His feare, and then we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that we are of them, to whom His ſaving mercy is decreed from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſome man will ſay. They that liſt, may goe ſo farre about, but I have a nearer way. For the Spirit certifyeth me by ſecret whiſperings, without conſidering of any ſuch qualification, that mercy is prepared for me from all eternity. I anſwer with S. John 1 ep. 4.1. <hi>Beloved, beleeve not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God.</hi> Now we have no rule, whereby to try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. The ſpirit therefore, which urges faith and good works according to the Scriptures, is plainly the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; Who having given us His Word of higheſt perfection, which nothing may be added to or taken from, doth not dictate any thing inwardly unto men, but according to that, which He (alwaies conſtant and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Himſelf) hath revealed in that word. But that ſpirit, which muttereth any thing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion contrary to Scripture, is moſt certainly the ſpirit of giddineſſe and of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If therefore we conſult the Scripture, we ſhall find both here and every where the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64461:136"/>ſame conſtant doctrine, <hi>That mercy is from all eternity decreed to them that feare God:</hi> but the Scripture no where ſaith that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to any of us by name without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this qualification. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Spirit, which by our perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the feare of God certifies us, that mercy is prepared for us from eternity, is the Spirit of God: but that which ſuggeſts to us that it is abſolutely prepared for us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration of ſuch qualification, is the ſpirit of errour. 2 Seeing the mercy of God unto all eternity is to men not ſimply but as <hi>fearing God;</hi> we muſt be carefull to perſevere in the feare of God, if we would certainly expect His mercy unto everlaſting. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The LORD is with us, Whileſt we are with Him: but if we forſake Him</hi> (which we doe, if we caſt away His feare) <hi>He will forſake us.</hi> For then we are no longer under the qualification, to which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is annexed.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64461:139"/>belongs unto him? 4 That I may come to the meaning of the place, the Prophet having foretold (<hi>chap.</hi> 53.10, 11.) the event of Chriſts death in the converſion of many both of the Jewes and gentiles, in this 54<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter ſpeaks of the nationall converſion of the Jewes yet to come. That he here ſpeaks of the Jewes, is plaine <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. (for to them, for their crucifying of Chriſt and rejecting the goſpell, had God given a bill of divorce; whereas the gentiles, being ſtrangers from the faith, could not properly be called <hi>a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>) 6, 7, 11. This covenant therefore ſeemes proper and peculiar to the Iſraelites, that they being once converted unto Chriſt God will no more be angry with them, but give them mercy and peace. But this is not to be underſtood of particular perſons, but of the nation; with which God will not ſo be any more angry, as to expoſe them to captivity and deſtruction as before, though with the impenitent, unbeleevers, and wicked livers He will be angry. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.18, 19, 20. 2 Whoſoever they be with whom this covenant is made, it is not abſolute, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a certain qualification, as appears by the concluſion of the chapter <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. God therefore compares this covenant with that made with Noah, in the firmneſſe of it (and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64461:140"/>ſo the covenant of grace alſo is like unto it) but not in the manner of promiſing. For that covenant of Noah God made not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with men, but with every living creature (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.12.) abſolutely: but this onely with men; not ſimply, but ſuch as are His ſervants, retaining and exerciſing the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe He beſtowes upon them.</p>

See con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Repentance performed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. omitted, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. concerning Faith performed, and omitted, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. concerning holy obedience performed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. omitted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such as think the Covenant hath indeed conditions, but to be performed by God, not by us. This opinion plainly contradicts this preſent place; where the keeping of Gods covenant is required of <hi>us.</hi> And ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where. Againe, if the ſtipulation muſt be performed by God; then He made His covenant not with men, but with Himſelf, viz. that if He Himſelf ſhall performe that which He ſtipulates or requires of Himſelf, then He will performe His promiſes unto men: which is abſurd. Furthermore, if God performe the ſtipulation, then He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, beleeves in his Saviour, and obeys: which is not onely abſurd, but blaſphemous to affirme. Laſtly, if the performance of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64461:141"/>ſtipulation belong to God, not to men; why ſhould He be angry at men, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and puniſh them for non-performance? <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.25. and often. For how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is it, and unbeſeeming Gods juſtice, to puniſh men for not keeping His covenant, if it doe not belong to them, but to Himſelf to keep it? For who knowes not, that he, and he onely, is to be puniſhed for not doing a thing, to whom it belongs to doe it? But theſe things are more abſurd, then to need longer confutation. And indeed it is to be wondred with what ſophiſtry the devil could perſwade men (and men, as themſelves think, not the meaneſt among thoſe that profeſſe the moſt pure religion of Chriſt) to entertain ſuch phantaſies contrary to the moſt cleare ſhining light of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Repr.</note> if they and they onely keep Gods covenant, who remember His commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to doe them; then all thoſe who do not remember His commandements to doe them, come here to be reproved as violaters of His covenant. Of theſe there are many ſorts. Some men doe ſome things for the ſubſtance of the acts, but not according to the manner here required; as never learning, or, if they do learne, forgetting what or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they ought to doe. Others doe ſome
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64461:142"/>things (after a faſhion) but wittingly and willingly break Gods commandements in other things, and ſo are guilty of the whole law. Others indeed remember Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but to prate or wrangle about them, not to doe them. Others caſting Gods commandements behind their backs, ruſh into all kind of ſinnes as a horſe into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Now we muſt know that this ſecond Covenant is the laſt. To the firſt Covenant (broken by Adam) this ſucceeded, opening unto men (guilty of eternall death by the firſt) a new way of ſalvation: And being confirmed by Gods oath and the death of Chriſt the Teſtatour, it ſhall remaine to the end of the world; nor ſhall there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way or meanes of ſalvation for ever. Wherefore it is ſimply impoſſible for any men to be ſaved, who finally tranſgreſſe this: yea the threatning annexed to it (no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine then the promiſe) ſhall inevitably lay hold upon them. And the evils denounced againſt the breakers of this covenant were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies from the very firſt making of it, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily heavy; but now under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo much the heavyer, by how much greater meanes of keeping it are afforded us.</p>

So covetous men, they think they are abſolute lords of all that they have (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11) otherwiſe how chance they will not lay out thoſe goods according to the owners will? So they, who abuſe the creatures; which ſurely are Gods creatures, He hath made them: nor ſhall any man goe unpuniſhed, that ſhall uſurp or uſe them otherwiſe then according to His will. <hi>The ſtone out of the wall ſhall cry</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Prophet Habakkuk ch. 2.11, 12.

And truly God deſires to be praiſed of us, not that He, being infinitely perfect, wants any thing in Himſelf, much leſſe any thing that we can beſtow upon Him: but He deſires our praiſes as He doth all our ſervice, firſt as that which of right belongs to Him; &amp; ſecondly for the good and ſalvation of them that praiſe and ſerve Him, and that by their example others may be invited to doe the like, and ſo to receive the like reward.</p>

               <p>This figure Apoſtrophe (converting the ſpeech in ſhew to perſons abſent, or to things without reaſon or life, when indeed it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to men that are preſent) is frequent in other authours, and not unfrequent in Scripture. Moſes <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to teach the ſong, which followes <hi>chap.</hi> 32. to the children of Iſrael; and ſo the thing therein intended was their inſtruction: yet in the beginning of it he converts his
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64461:156"/>ſpeech by an Apoſtrophe to the heavens and the earth. See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Job</hi> 16.18. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 114.5. &amp;c. <hi>&amp;</hi> 148.3. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. And ſo here that there is an Apoſtrophe <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. where he ſpeaks to <hi>all the works of God,</hi> it is manifeſt; ſeeing very many, yea innumerable of Gods works have neither voice, wherewith to bleſſe God, nor yet eares, or at leaſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to be capable of the Pſalmiſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. And that the ſame figure is uſed in his ſpeech to the Angels in theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may plainly enough be gathered. 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (beſide that no man can ordinarily know what Angels are preſent, or where, or when) no man hath any warrant to exhort the Angels (the conſtant tenour of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being, <hi>Exhort one another—teaching and admoniſhing one another</hi> &amp;c.) 2 Becauſe the holy Angels need not mans exhortation to bleſſe God, or to performe any part of their duty. This latter reaſon Calvin upon this place urges, <hi>Certè</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Angeli ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gìs voluntarii ſunt ad hoc officium &amp; ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, quàm ut indigeant noſtris ſtimulis.</hi> And to this ſenſe he expounds the place, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Sed quamvìs celeriter pracurrant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli nos vix lentè ſequamur; David tamen noſtrâ causâ canendas Dei laudes illis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64461:157"/>ut eorum exemplo expergefaciat noſtrum torporem.</hi> Although therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid converts his ſpeech to the Angels, yet his intent is to declare unto us what they doe, that we may imitate them. So when he ſpeaks to the ſea, to Jordan, to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and hills, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 114. he doth not propound queſtions as if he were ignorant of what he inquires, much leſſe as if he expected an anſwer from things without life. But the proper ſenſe of the words (the figurative ſpeech being explained) is this, O men, ſee how it behoves you to obey God and to feare before Him, taking example even from the ſea and Jordan, which went back at His command, from the mountaines and hills, which ſo trembled at His preſence (eſpecially at the promulgation of the Law) that they ſeemed to skip like rammes and lambes. In like manner here, he ſpeaking by Apoſtrophe to the Angels, the ſenſe is, O men, know ye that the holy Angels bleſſe God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye alſo ought to imitate them.</p>

The good Angels therefore are Gods Angels, not onely becauſe created and preſerved by Him, but alſo becauſe by covenant bound to doe His commandements. 3 In reſpect of their actuall obedience, and keeping His covenant.</p>

They know alſo the excellency of Gods works, of creation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and government of all creatures, redemption of mankind &amp;c. and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſplendency of Gods Attributes from all theſe. The foundation alſo of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving being Beneficence, this God hath
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64461:170"/>ſhewed to the Angels in a high degree. For He brought them out of nothing to ſo great a height of dignity by creation: and when they uſed aright the grace which He firſt gave them, He beſtowed upon them a further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of grace, whereby, when others through their own fault fell, they ſtood: He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo given them their habitation in the higheſt heavens &amp;c.

                  <p>For our inſtruction.<note place="margin">Inſtr.</note> 1 We ſee that in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bleſſing (whereof here) the Angels are not the Objects, but the Agents. We may indeed and ought to praiſe men, who truly have or do any good; as eſpecially the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their ſpirituall graces and the fruits of them, which are eminently good, ſo both them and others for the good things of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature.

But of religious praiſe the adequate object is onely God (from Whom deſcends every good and perfect gift; in Whom all things live, move, and have their beeing; by whoſe onely power the creatures doe whatſoever good proceeds from them) and to Him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this praiſe to be given, and no way communicable to men or Angels, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature; but on the contrary, all that praiſe which is given to them, is ultimately to be referred unto God, and to be terminated in Him. So for thankſgiving, we may render it unto men, who have been beneficiall unto us, but ſo, that it muſt be chiefly and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately referred unto God, Who gives them power and will to doe us good, and by His bleſſing makes to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eir benefits truly profitable to us. But in this we may not proceed ſo farre with the Angels. For although it be certaine that we receive many benefits from them: yet, which of them, among ſo many myriads, are our benefactours, we know not, ſeeing they are ſpirits, and ſo inviſible; nor, if we did know, can we (by reaſon of their inviſibility) tell when they are preſent to heare us. Or if at any time we might give them thanks, yet it muſt be done onely in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64461:171"/>ſubordination to God, by Whoſe power, and at Whoſe command they doe us good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 See the dignity of this duty, as in other reſpects, ſo in that it is the work of Angels, even the higheſt and greateſt of them, and that in heaven their bleſſed habitation.

For although the tradition before mentioned of Michaels being precentour is not ſo certaine, yet certain it is that the greater Angels do the more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſe God; both becauſe by reaſon of their more ſublime underſtanding they more fully apprehend Gods excellency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and becauſe being by God enriched with more excellent gifts they are both more</p>

                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:64461:172"/> 2 There lies a greater neceſſity upon us (partly of doing this duty, and partly of being exhorted to it) then upon the Angels. For 1 the Angels in heaven need not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to bleſſe God, but are willing and ready of themſelves to doe it: But the beſt of mortall men are not ſo forward to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that they need to be excited by the exhortation and example of others. 2 The excellency of God is clearly known to the Angels: but amongſt men many litle under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, none ſufficiently. And therefore, God diſtributing His gifts diverſly, whileſt every man utters what God gives him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of the Divine perfections and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, all may be mutually inſtructed one by another. And hereupon ſeemes to have been grounded that which David divers times in the Pſalmes, and Hezekiah <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18. ſpeaks concerning the dead not prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God; that is, they can not doe it ſo profitably in reſpect of other men, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may. 3 We have greater cauſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, then the Angels have. Thomas 22<hi rend="sup">z</hi>. qu. 106.2.0. moving the queſtion, Whether an innocent or a penitent man be more bound to thank God, anſwers, that an innocent man is more bound in reſpect of the greatneſſe of the benefit <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi>

So here, the graciouſneſſe or freeneſſe of Gods beneficence (at which gratitude looks more then at the greatneſſe of the benefit) is much more conſpicuous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men: ſeeing God was indeed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully good and bountifull to the Angels, creating them of nothing, enduing them with many excellent gifts, upholding and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening them with His grace, and all this without their merit; but to man He was good and gracious notwithſtanding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of his ſinnes. Whileſt we were His e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, He ſo loved us, that whereas His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice being offended by ſinne, put a barre to our ſalvation, He ſpared not His onely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne but delivered Him up to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and curſed death, whereby His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice might be ſatisfyed, and our ſalvation obteined; that He ſends His Spirit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what His Sonne hath impetrated; that He ſhewes forth and exerciſes His Mercy, Patience, Meekneſſe, Clemency, Facility to pardon; laſtly, that He hath prepared for us a condition in ſome reſpect ſuperiour to the Angels.</p>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64461:175"/>in giving Him thanks, but alſo in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Him. And therefore if there were any ſuch creatures, for which we were not to thank God, yet even for thoſe alſo Hee were to be praiſed, if they make for His praiſe. And that even thoſe creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, with the like, doe ſo, is evident, in that the <hi>Goodneſſe, Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, are declared in the creation of them. His <hi>Power</hi> without doubt: His <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> alſo, at leaſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating good to them (beeing, life, motion &amp;c.) and continuing it to His good pleaſure: and laſtly, His <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> at leaſt in making them ſo various, and all in their ſeverall kinds ſo fit for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing mens ſinnes to the glory of His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But 2 God alſo in wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mercy: neither hath He made any creatures, which are not ſome waies profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto men, and ſo contein arguments of gratitude alſo. All thoſe mentioned, and the like make for the exerciſe of carefulneſſe, induſtry &amp;c. and to keep us from idleneſſe, to which we are ſo prone ſince the fall, and which is a vice ſo foule in it ſelf, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many more. They make alſo for the humbling us for our ſinnes the cauſes of thoſe annoyances from the creatures; for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64461:176"/>weaning us from this world, where we are ſubject to ſo many dangers and calamities, and to enflame us with a deſire of heaven, where is perfect happineſſe. In ſpeciall, That ſome creatures aſſault our perſons, it may admoniſh us how by the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for our rebellion againſt Him, theſe creatures alſo rebell againſt us; and may warne us to take heed of ſinne for the future, leſt theſe prove but the beginning of ſorrowes. The dangers alſo to which our life is by theſe meanes liable, may put us in mind of the uncertainty thereof, and ſo prepare us for death; that whenſoever it ſhall happen, we may live eternally in the world to come <hi>Job</hi> 5.17. to the end of the Chapter. That other creatures alſo are hurtfull to the things we poſſeſſe, it may ſerve to draw us from the immoderate love of thoſe things, and to excite us to lay up treaſures for our ſelves in heaven, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moth &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20. Laſtly, all the aforeſayd creatures, if men knew rightly how to uſe them, are perhaps (beſide the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall uſe before ſpecifyed) naturally more profitable then hurtfull unto man. Of many it is plaine. Nettles, poppy, and other weeds, though hurtfull to corne, yet are helpfull in phyſick, for preſerving life, which is
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64461:176"/>more then meat. So are antidotes made of poiſons.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 If the works of Creation, then much more the work of Redemption, as being farre more noble. In the Creation appeared won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <hi>Goodneſſe, Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> but to the work of Redemption all theſe three Attributes are required in a greater degree; and others alſo beſide, whereof in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was no need. And the reaſon is from the different condition of the object. The object of Creation was pure Nothing: wherein as there was no help, ſo there was no hindrance to Gods working. But in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Redemption was ſinne, not onely bringing death, but vehemently hindring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Here therefore was required 1 Greater <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> viz. not onely ſimply free, communicating good to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it not, but alſo mercifull, doing good to them that deſerved ill. 2 Greater <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> which might find out a way how Gods Juſtice offended by mens ſinnes, and His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which had pity on them, might ſo meet together and kiſſe each other, that both Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64461:177"/>might have fitting ſatisfaction for mens ſinnes, and yet Mercy might have full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in procuring their ſalvation. 3 Greater <hi>Power,</hi> ſeeing the termes were more diſtant, and the way more difficult. 1 The termes were more diſtant. In the Creation, man (the moſt noble creature next to the Angels) was taken out of the earth, formed after the image of God, and placed in a happy condition. But when he was redeemed, he was taken out of a condition worſe then the earth (<hi>Job</hi> 30.8.) and then nothing (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.24.) and brought (at laſt) to an eſtate better and more worthy, then Adam either had, or by perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in his innocency ſhould have attained, yea, then the Angels either have or can have, in reſpect of the union with Chriſt by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bond. 2 The way alſo was more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. For in the Creation, God onely ſpake the word, and it was done: but Gods Juſtice oppoſed Redemption; whereupon the Sonne of His love took upon Him the forme of a ſervant, and being made under the law for ſo many yeares did and ſuffred ſo many and ſo great things for the ſatisfaction of Juſtice. Another impediment alſo there was from the infidelity of men hindring the application of this Redemption: for Chriſt neither did nor would ſo ſatisfy Juſtice, that men ſhould be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64461:178"/>fully made partakers of redemption without the meanes of faith. For the removing of this impediment therefore the Holy Spirit ſent by Chriſt the Mediatour for this purpoſe, ſtrives with men in much patience, long-ſuffring, gentleneſſe, clemency &amp;c. Seeing then in the Redemption there was required, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſhewed, a greater degree of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Wiſdome, and Power, (and beſides, Mercy, Patience, Long-ſuffring &amp;c. for the exerciſing whereof there was no occaſion in the Creation) it is manifeſt, that Redemption is the more noble work, and affords greater matter of bleſſing God both by way of praiſe, and by way of thankſgiving.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If God be to be bleſſed for His works, then alſo for His word. David joines both together <hi>Pſal</hi> 19. praiſing God for His works in the ſix firſt verſes, for His word verſ. 7 &amp;c. And ſo in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Pſalme, and elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where frequently in this book of Pſalmes. And much more cauſe have we to doe it; ſeeing the Scripture is now much fuller then it was in Davids time, viz. by addition not onely of a great part of the Old Teſtament, but alſo of all the New. And herein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and beneficence of God do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lay open themſelves, as might eaſily be ſhewed.
